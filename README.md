## Object Detection from Video


object detection from video by using Faster R-CNN and Siamese.
My object detection algorithm is composed of two networks which are Faster R-CNN and Fully-Convolutional Siamese Networks.


I used Faster R-CNN as a still-image detector.
You can find the original paper and code of Faster R-CNN in the link below.

Also I used Fully-convolutional Siamese Networks as a tracker.
You can find the original paper and code of Fully-convolutional Siamese Networks in the link below.

My algorithm can be applied to ImageNet Object Detection from Video Challenge.

Details about the challenge are in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/imagenet-object-detection-from-video-challenge) and [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2017/)
